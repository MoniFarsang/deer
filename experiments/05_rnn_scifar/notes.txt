0: 64 hiddens, 8 heads, 64 hiddens mlp, scifar on adam-onecyclelr(1e-5 to 6e-4 to 1e-6 in 100k + 160k) (182,154 params)
1 & 4: like 0, but bidirectional (slightly better than #0)
5: like 0, but wrap with lin+act+lin+glu (slightly worse than #0, very early stopped)
6: like 0, but adam(6e-4)
7: like 0, but adam(6e-4) and batch size = 64
8: like 0, but adam(6e-4) and p_dropout = 0.1
9: 


scaling:
* use A100
* use onecyclelr
* mlp larger hidden size
* more heads
