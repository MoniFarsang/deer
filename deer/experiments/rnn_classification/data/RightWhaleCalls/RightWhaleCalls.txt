The problem is to classify a case as a right whale or not based on an audio signal.

That positive cases contain a set of right whale up-calls. Up-calls
are the most commonly documented right whale vocalisation with an
acoustic signature of approximately 60Hz-250Hz, typically lasting 1
second. Each series is labelled as either containing a right whale
or not with the aim to correctly identify the series that contain
up-calls.

Right whale calls can often be difficult to hear as the low
frequency band can become congested with anthropogenic sounds such
as ship noise, drilling, piling, or naval operations.

The data is from the Marinexplore and Cornell University Whale Detection Challenge.

Each case is a two second audio segment sampled at 2kHz, giving
a series length of 4000. We have done no preprocessing of the data.
The dataset contains 10,934 train cases and 5885
test cases.
