2: default settings
3: lr=1e-4 (stuck)
4: like #3, but increasing the weights by 100 time points every time (going down, but I interrupted it very early)
5: default settings with float64
6: default settings with RNN (~25 s/it)
7: default settings with progressive weights over time and lr=1e-4 (initially 3.93 it/s)
CHANGED THE DATASET SO V0=0.7 to 1.0
9: default settings
10: default settings with float64, with progressive lengths from 20 increment 20
